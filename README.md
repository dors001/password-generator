## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This project thought me a lot more about using CSS tricks to calculate and design the assets that i need for the assignment.
There were some logical tricks that i needed to figure about about the password generating flow and it was worth while because it opened my mind to new ways i can tackle an issue.
In summary it was a fun, short project that showed me how i progressed through the year with react.

### Continued development

Next on the agenda is to learn caching and routing in order to create a more extensive websites.
